# K-Means Algorithms

This is a repository containing the K-means Algorithm written from scrath in Python, using only NumPy. Please, open the file `README_extendended.ipynb` in your browser (since GitHub supports `.ipynb` files natively, and we can write LaTeX on it) for detailed information.

To run the program clone the repository and create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv .venv` and activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`. Then install the needed packages with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. Finally run `python3 main.py`. In order to have fun with the program, please modify the `parameters_INput.py` file.
